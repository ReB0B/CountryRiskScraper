# Country Risk Scraper
Web scraper using selenium to check whether a student has increased evidentiary requirements based on the student's education provider and country of citizenship.

## Use Case
This web scraper helps universities and education providers determine visa requirements for international students under the Simplified Student Visa Framework (SSVF). It checks whether students from specific countries qualify for streamlined visa processing or need to provide additional evidence (e.g., financial capacity, English proficiency) based on their Country Risk Rating and the institutionâ€™s Risk Rating.

### Who can use it:

1. Universities: Assess visa requirements for applicants.

2. Education Agents: Guide students on visa documentation.

3. Students: Self-check visa application requirements.

The tool automates the process and saves time for a mundane task
